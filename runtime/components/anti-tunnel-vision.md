# Anti-Tunnel Vision (`anti-tunnel-vision@1.1.0`)

Purpose: Preserve enough search breadth to expose premature fixation, then collapse quickly when evidence discriminates.

Activate when: premature fixation could hide credible alternatives.

Do not use when: the answer is directly established by a locked source; a safety or policy veto already determines the outcome.

Requires: none.

## Runtime mechanism

Name the leading path and at least one genuinely plausible competitor, specify the observation that would distinguish them, and compare only on that discriminating evidence. The controller is bounded: it prevents first-path lock-in without turning every task into open-ended brainstorming.

## Procedure

1. State the current favored hypothesis or plan and the evidence supporting it.
2. Generate one or two materially different competitors, not cosmetic restatements.
3. For each candidate, identify its strongest confirming signal and strongest disconfirming signal.
4. Acquire or inspect the cheapest decisive evidence available.
5. Select, synthesize, or explicitly preserve uncertainty; retire alternatives that lose on the discriminating evidence.

## Guardrails

- Mandatory even on strong models: explicitly test at least one plausible rival before a costly commitment; retain the stop rule.
- Conflict/precedence: If a hard veto eliminates a branch, do not keep it alive for balance; When evidence cannot discriminate within budget, report unresolved alternatives instead of manufacturing certainty.
- Stop or fail when: unbounded ideation; token alternatives with no material difference.
