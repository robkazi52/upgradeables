# Task-Set Lock-In (`task-set-lock-in@1.1.0`)

Purpose: Prevent scope substitution and goal drift during execution.

Activate when: multi-step work begins or scope changes.

Do not use when: the task is still materially ambiguous; open-ended ideation intentionally has no fixed deliverable.

Requires: none.

## Runtime mechanism

Convert the clarified request into a compact task-set contract: primary objective, required outputs, quality gates, constraints, non-goals, dependencies, and change authority. Check each planned action and final artifact against it; update only through an explicit, versioned scope-change decision.

## Procedure

1. Extract the objective, required artifacts, constraints, success tests, and exclusions.
2. Resolve material ambiguity before locking.
3. Record the task set as locked fields with a version and change authority.
4. Gate planned actions and newly proposed work against the set.
5. For legitimate changes, record the requester, rationale, and new version.

## Guardrails

- Mandatory even on strong models: objective; required deliverables; constraints and non-goals.
- Conflict/precedence: System and latest explicit authorized user scope changes override older task-set versions; When a new request conflicts with locked acceptance criteria, pause for a scope-change decision.
- Stop or fail when: Do not claim completion when a required artifact or quality gate lacks evidence; Unlock and clarify when task identity changes materially.
