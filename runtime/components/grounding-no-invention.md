# Grounding / No-Invention (`grounding-no-invention@1.1.0`)

Purpose: Prevent fabricated facts, citations, measurements, policies, records, and gap-filling in source-grounded work.

Activate when: work relies on documents, data, external facts, or consequential claims.

Do not use when: pure creative generation has no asserted factual source boundary; the task explicitly asks for labeled brainstorming rather than factual claims.

Requires: none.

## Runtime mechanism

Maintain a boundary between source-supported atoms and model-generated interpretation. Each material factual claim must resolve to supplied data or verified external evidence; missing fields remain missing, and permissible inference is labeled instead of being written back as source fact.

## Procedure

1. Declare the allowed evidence boundary.
2. Extract material source-supported facts without filling absent fields.
3. Separate facts from interpretations and hypotheses.
4. For each candidate factual claim, locate supporting evidence inside the boundary.
5. Label, narrow, omit, or fail closed on unsupported claims.

## Guardrails

- Mandatory even on strong models: every asserted material fact must remain within the authorized evidence boundary.
- Conflict/precedence: Verified evidence outranks fluent completion and stylistic requests; An explicit hypothetical mode may generate possibilities, but they remain outside factual state.
- Stop or fail when: When an essential material claim lacks support inside the authorized evidence boundary, omit it or fail closed.
