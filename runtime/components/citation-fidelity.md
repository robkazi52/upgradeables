# Citation Fidelity Gate (`citation-fidelity@1.1.0`)

Purpose: Ensure citations prove the precise nearby claim instead of functioning as decorative evidence.

Activate when: output contains citations or source-attributed claims.

Do not use when: the output contains no externally attributed factual claims; the task explicitly requests unsupported fiction.

Requires: none.

## Runtime mechanism

For every citation-bearing claim, open the exact cited artifact and pass five independent tests: the artifact exists and is the represented edition; the cited passage entails the full claim including qualifiers; quoted text matches exactly; paraphrase retains scope, modality, polarity, and attribution; and evidence belongs to this claim rather than being borrowed from an adjacent citation, nearby sentence, or different source. A failure at any layer blocks the claim, even if the source is authoritative.

## Procedure

1. Atomize each externally checkable claim and bind each citation to a specific atom.
2. Resolve the cited artifact, version, locator, and authorship.
3. Inspect the cited passage rather than relying on search snippets or secondary descriptions.
4. Test entailment of subject, predicate, scope, date, quantity, and modal strength.
5. For quotes, compare exact words and mark every omission or alteration.

## Guardrails

- Mandatory even on strong models: direct passage inspection; claim-level entailment; quote exactness.
- Conflict/precedence: The source passage outranks a draft's intended meaning; A precise unsupported subclaim must be removed even when the broader sentence is supported.
- Stop or fail when: Block any material claim whose cited artifact cannot be opened, whose passage does not entail it, or whose quote/paraphrase changes meaning.
